# Deploy and Host fabio on Railway

Fabio is a zero-configuration HTTP/HTTPS load balancer that provides automatic service discovery and routing. Built for high performance and simplicity, fabio automatically routes traffic to healthy backend services without requiring manual configuration changes, making it perfect for microservices architectures.

## About Hosting fabio

Hosting fabio on Railway involves deploying a lightweight load balancer that can route traffic to your backend services. This template provides a fully configured fabio instance with environment variable customization, static routing configuration, and optimized performance settings. The deployment includes automatic health checks, logging configuration, and support for both round-robin and random load balancing strategies. Railway's infrastructure handles scaling and availability while fabio manages intelligent traffic distribution.

## Common Use Cases

- **API Gateway**: Route incoming requests to multiple backend services based on URL paths
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application for better performance
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Route traffic between different versions of your services for zero-downtime deployments
- **Microservices Routing**: Centralize routing logic for complex microservices architectures
- **SSL Termination**: Handle HTTPS traffic and forward to internal HTTP services

## Dependencies for fabio Hosting

- **Backend Services**: At least one backend service that fabio can route traffic to
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Backend services should provide health check endpoints for optimal routing

### Deployment Dependencies

- [Fabio Official Documentation](https://fabiolb.net/)
- [Railway Platform Documentation](https://docs.railway.app/)

### Implementation Details

This template uses a startup script with `envsubst` for dynamic configuration:

```bash
# Generate configuration from template
envsubst < /etc/fabio/fabio.properties.template > /etc/fabio/fabio.properties

# Start fabio with generated config
exec fabio -cfg /etc/fabio/fabio.properties
```

Key environment variables for configuration:
```bash
FABIO_BACKEND_HOST=your-service.railway.internal
FABIO_BACKEND_PORT=8000
FABIO_LB_STRATEGY=rnd  # or 'rr' for round-robin
FABIO_LOG_LEVEL=WARN   # Reduces log verbosity
```

## Why Deploy fabio on Railway?

Railway is a singular platform to deploy your infrastructure stack. Railway will host your infrastructure so you don't have to deal with configuration, while allowing you to vertically and horizontally scale it.

By deploying fabio on Railway, you are one step closer to supporting a complete full-stack application with minimal burden. Host your servers, databases, AI agents, and more on Railway.
